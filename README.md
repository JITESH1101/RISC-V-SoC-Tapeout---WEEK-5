# RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout---WEEK-5

This week, the focus shifts from individual transistor-level circuits to the automated backend implementation of a full digital design. The OpenROAD Flow Scripts environment is being set up to serve as the foundation for this process.

The primary objectives are to execute the first two critical stages of the physical design flow: floorplanning, where the chip's core area and I/O are defined, and placement, where standard cells are arranged to meet timing and area constraints. This begins the practical conversion of a logical netlist into a physical layout.

# Open Road Tool Installation

First to install the tool We can clone the github repository , enter the following command

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD.git
cd OpenROAD
```
